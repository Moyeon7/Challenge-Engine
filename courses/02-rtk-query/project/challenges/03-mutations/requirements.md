# Challenge 03: Technical Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. ✅ Must have mutation endpoints (create, update, delete)
2. ✅ Must implement optimistic updates
3. ✅ Must invalidate cache tags on mutation
4. ✅ Must handle mutation loading states
5. ✅ Must handle mutation error states
6. ✅ Must handle mutation success states
7. ✅ UI must update optimistically

## Code Quality Requirements
