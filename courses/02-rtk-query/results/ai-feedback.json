      "feedback": [],
      "strengths": [
        "The code is well-structured and follows a clear separation of concerns between the store configuration and the application components.",
        "The use of TypeScript type annotations is a good practice that improves code readability and maintainability.",
        "The code is concise and easy to understand, with clear and descriptive variable names."
      ],
      "improvements": [
        "In the `store.ts` file, the reducer object is currently empty. It would be beneficial to add a comment or a placeholder to indicate where the reducer should be implemented.",
        "In the `UsersList.tsx` file, the TODO comment could be more specific and provide a clear instruction on how to implement the useGetUsersQuery hook.",
        "In the `App.tsx` file, the ChallengeList component is imported but not used. It would be better to remove unused imports to keep the code clean and organized."

      "overall": "The code provided is a good starting point for building a data-driven dashboard with RTK Query. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the Redux Toolkit configuration and the use of TypeScript type annotations. However, there are some minor improvements that can be made to enhance code readability and maintainability."
