      "strengths": [
        "The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear separation of concerns between components.",
        "The use of TypeScript and Next.js App Router provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications.",
        "The code is concise and free of unnecessary complexity."

      "improvements": [
        "Consider adding JSDoc comments to explain the purpose and behavior of each component, especially for more complex logic.",
        "In the `Home` component, the `ChallengeList` component is not imported with a default import, which can lead to potential issues if the component is renamed or moved. Consider using a named import instead.",
        "In the `layout.tsx` file, the `metadata` object is not validated or sanitized, which can lead to potential security issues if user-input data is used to populate the metadata. Consider using a library like `next-seo` to handle metadata validation and sanitization."
