# Challenge 03: Technical Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. ✅ Must have Client Component with 'use client' directive
2. ✅ Must implement Server Actions or API route for form handling
3. ✅ Must add metadata (title, description) to pages
4. ✅ Must handle form validation
5. ✅ Must display success/error messages
6. ✅ Form submission must work correctly
7. ✅ Must handle form state properly

## Code Quality Requirements

1. ✅ Must use TypeScript with proper type annotations
2. ✅ Form handling must be properly typed (form data, validation)
3. ✅ Code must pass ESLint checks (no errors, warnings allowed)
4. ✅ No console.log, console.error, or console.warn statements in production code
5. ✅ Code must be readable and well-structured
6. ✅ Variable and function names must be descriptive and follow camelCase convention

## Architecture Requirements

1. ✅ Must use 'use client' directive appropriately (only where needed)
2. ✅ Must use Server Actions or API routes for form handling
3. ✅ Must use Next.js metadata API (export metadata or generateMetadata)
4. ✅ Must follow Next.js best practices
5. ✅ Must separate Server and Client Components properly
6. ✅ Components must be functional components (not class components)

## Best Practices Requirements

1. ✅ Client Components must have 'use client' directive at the top
2. ✅ Server Actions must be properly defined and typed
3. ✅ Form validation must be implemented (client-side and/or server-side)
4. ✅ Must handle form state properly (controlled components)
5. ✅ Must display success/error messages to users
6. ✅ Metadata must be properly configured (title, description)
7. ✅ Must use TypeScript interfaces/types for form data
8. ✅ Error handling must be implemented (display error messages)
9. ✅ Must follow Next.js form handling best practices
10. ✅ Code must be maintainable and follow single responsibility principle

## Industry Standards

The following industry standards will be checked:

- **TypeScript**: Proper type safety, form data types
- **Next.js Patterns**: Server Actions, Client Components, metadata API
- **Code Style**: ESLint compliance, consistent formatting
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components
- **Form Handling**: Proper validation, error handling, state management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of form errors
- **Component Design**: Proper separation of Server and Client Components

## Scoring

- Functional correctness: 40%
- Code quality: 25%
- Architecture: 20%
- Best practices: 10%
- AI review: 5%
