        "The code is well-structured and follows a clear, concise naming convention.",
        "The use of TypeScript interfaces and type annotations is excellent for maintaining code quality and reducing errors.",

        "Consider adding a default alt text to the image element to improve accessibility. Currently, the alt text is hardcoded to `${name} profile`, which may not be suitable for all cases.",
        "The placeholder for the avatar could be improved by using a more visually appealing approach, such as a circular div with the first letter of the name. This would enhance the overall user experience.",
        "The button's text could be improved by adding a more descriptive label, such as 'Follow/Unfollow' or 'Toggle Follow Status'. This would provide better context for users with visual impairments or those who rely on screen readers."
