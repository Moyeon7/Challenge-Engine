        "Proper use of TypeScript with type annotations for props and component",

        "Clear and concise code structure"
      ],
      "improvements": [
        "Add state management for the follow button using React hooks (useState)",
        "Implement toggle functionality for the follow button",
        "Consider using a more robust solution for conditional rendering (e.g., ternary operator)"

      "overall": "The provided code is a good start for the UserProfile component. It demonstrates a clear understanding of TypeScript and functional component patterns. However, it lacks the implementation of state management and toggle functionality for the follow button, which are crucial for a dynamic user profile component."
