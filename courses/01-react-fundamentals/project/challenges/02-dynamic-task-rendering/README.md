# Challenge 02: Dynamic Task Rendering

**Work on this challenge only.** You've completed Challenge 01 (TaskCard, TaskList, placeholders for TaskForm and TaskApp). Now read this README and implement this step.

## Goal

Make the list dynamic: state with at least 5 tasks, render with `map()`, unique `key`, and a task count (e.g. "5 Tasks").

## What to do

1. **State**  
   In the component that renders this challenge’s view, use the task array App already holds in state (App passes `tasks` and `setTasks` to TaskApp). Each task: `id` (string or number), `title`, `description`, `priority`, `completed` (boolean). Minimum 5 tasks. E2E expects at least 5 tasks and count text **5 Tasks**; use titles like **First Task**, **Second Task** so tests can find them.

2. **TaskList**  
   Accept a `tasks` prop. Use `map()` to render a TaskCard per task with `key={task.id}`. Pass `title`, `description`, `priority` (and later for Ch4: `completed`, `onToggle`).

3. **Task count**  
   Show count above the list (e.g. "5 Tasks"). Use an element with `id="task-count"`.

4. **Route and wiring**  
   You don’t change `App.tsx`. It already imports `TaskApp` from `./components` and renders `<TaskApp tasks={tasks} setTasks={setTasks} showForm={false} countFormat="tasks" />` at `/challenge/02-dynamic-task-rendering`. (In Challenge 18, App may pass `dispatch` instead of `setTasks`; TaskApp can accept either.) Replace your **TaskApp** placeholder with a real component: it receives `tasks`, `setTasks`, `showForm`, `countFormat` from App; it imports `TaskList` and passes `tasks` and `countText` (e.g. "5 Tasks") to it, and renders the count in an element with `id="task-count"`. Update your **TaskList** to accept a `tasks` prop (and optional `countText`, `onToggle` for later) and use `map()` to render TaskCards with `key={task.id}`. **Important:** When `tasks` is not passed (e.g. on route 01), keep showing your 3 hardcoded tasks so Challenge 01 still works (e.g. `const list = tasks ?? HARDCODED_TASKS`). When `tasks` is passed but empty, render nothing or an empty list. Keep exporting TaskList and the `Task` type from `src/components/index.ts`.

5. **Code**  
   TypeScript, functional components, no `console.*`, pass ESLint.

## Review

Tests check: tasks from state; ≥5 tasks; each TaskCard has `key`; task count with `id="task-count"`; E2E on the route. Pass threshold: **≥ 80%**. (State may be held with `useState` or later with `useReducer` in Challenge 18; tests accept either.)

## Verify

- `npm run dev` → open `/challenge/02-dynamic-task-rendering` → see 5+ tasks and count.
- `npm run review -- --challenge=02-dynamic-task-rendering`
