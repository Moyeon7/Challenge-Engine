# Learning Philosophy: Help vs Completion

## In One Sentence

**We help you understand the system and the requirements; we do not help you skip the work of learning.**

---

## Help = Clarity and Tooling

We provide:

- **Clear requirements** — What to build, which files, which patterns
- **Working environment** — App runs, tests run, review runs
- **Documentation** — Setup, workflow, troubleshooting, FAQ
- **Strict criteria** — So you know exactly what "done" means
- **Feedback** — Test failures, lint, architecture checks, AI review

This is **help**: you are not guessing. You know what to do and how to check it.

---

## Completion = Your Work

We do **not** provide:

- Solution code for challenges
- Step-by-step implementation that you copy
- Ways to get a passing score without implementing yourself

**Completion is strict.** Passing a challenge means *your* code meets the requirements. The review and tests are the judge. No exceptions.

---

## Why This Is Strict

1. **Credibility** — Badges and scores mean something only if they reflect real ability.
2. **Learning** — You learn by doing. Reading or copying answers does not build skill.
3. **Fairness** — Everyone is evaluated by the same automated criteria.
4. **Realism** — In real work you get requirements and docs, not full solutions.

---

## What "Help" Does Not Mean

- **Help** ≠ We give you the code to complete the challenge  
- **Help** ≠ We relax the requirements so you pass without meeting them  
- **Help** ≠ We tell you exactly what to type line by line  

**Help** = We make the system, the requirements, and the process clear. You do the implementation.

---

## What to Expect

- You will read docs and requirements.
- You will write and debug your own code.
- You will use tests and review feedback to improve.
- You will pass when your implementation satisfies the stated criteria.

That is how you learn—and how completion stays meaningful.
